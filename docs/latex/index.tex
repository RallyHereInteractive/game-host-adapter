An SDK for handling multiple different types of game hosting systems in one set of calls\hypertarget{index_intro_sec}{}\doxysection{Introduction}\label{index_intro_sec}
This library as meant to be used as part of integrating game instance servers with Rally\+Here. The source code for the entire system is provided, but one should only target and use the C API directly. This will enable Rally\+Here to update your game servers to be able to support different game hosting providers without the need for the code in the game server to change.\hypertarget{index_getting_started}{}\doxysection{Getting Started}\label{index_getting_started}
The main usage of this library is to set up your memory allocator, initialize the sdk, instantiate a game instance adapter, and then tick that either asserting or waiting for allocations to come in with additional details.
