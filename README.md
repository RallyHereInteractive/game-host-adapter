# game-host-adapter
An SDK for handling multiple different types of game hosting systems in one set of calls

This library as meant to be used as part of integrating game instance servers with RallyHere. The source code for the entire system is provided, but one should only target and use the C API directly. This will enable RallyHere to update your game servers to be able to support different game hosting providers without the need for the code in the game server to change.
